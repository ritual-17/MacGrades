# MacGrades
The goal of this project is to allow McMaster students to calculate their cGPA at any time using their unofficial transcripts.
## Usage
* Copy the file in [latest release](https://github.com/ritual-17/MacGrades/releases/latest) (zip archive release-xxx.zip)
to the desired folder containing your transcript pdf.
* To run program, `java -jar MacGrades.jar [yourTranscript.pdf]`.

## Known Issues
* Graduate courses are not currently supported, so behaviour may be unexpected.
* If there are other grade types I am forgetting (besides P, NC, COM, etc.), let me know
by opening an issue.
